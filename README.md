Mastering Maya exercises
===========================

During the game development degree at Full Sail University we were instructed on some light 3D modelling concepts.
This was because programmers tend to be isolated from the art pipelines. After completing this course I understood how the asset creation work-flow looks like.

I was able to create my own (low quality) assets and models.
